    It takes the list returned by the collectMaterial function, and returns
    music21.stream.Stream with all the segments conatined in the material list
    concatenated into a single stave. It also returns the material list with a
    new list appended with the information to reconstruct the segments in their
    original scores from the new concatenated score. This new list contain a
    list of integers indicating:
    [start, end, score, part, segment]
    So that,
    - start: indicates the starting offset of a segment in the concatenated
             score
    - end: indicates the ending offset of a segment in the concatenated score
    - score: indicates the index in the material list of the score from where
             the original segment came from
    - part: indicates the index of the part in the previous score
    - segment: indicates the index of the segment as stored for the previous
               part in the material list
    If a title is given, it generates an xml file with the concatenated score
    and a pickle file with the material list
